<p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Flow super-resolution (FSR) enables inferring fine-grained urban flows with coarse-grained observations and plays an important role in traffic monitoring and prediction. The existing FSR solutions rely on deep CNN models (e.g., ResNet) for learning spatial correlation, incurring excessive memory cost and numerous parameter updates. We propose to tackle the urban flows inference using dynamic systems paradigm and present a new method FODE – FSR with Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs). FODE extends neural ODEs by introducing an affine coupling layer to overcome the problem of numerically unstable gradient computation, which allows more accurate and efficient spatial correlation estimation, without extra memory cost. In addition, FODE provides a flexible balance between flow inference accuracy and computational efficiency. A FODE-based augmented normalization mechanism is further introduced to constrain the flow distribution with the influence of external factors. Experimental evaluations on two real-world datasets demonstrate that FODE significantly outperforms several baseline approaches.</p>

<p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Large volumes of urban statistical data with multiple views imply rich knowledge about the development degree of cities. These data present crucial statistics which play an irreplaceable role in the regional analysis and urban computing. In reality, however, the statistical data divided into fine-grained regions usually suffer from missing data problems. Those missing values hide the useful information that may result in a distorted data analysis. Thus, in this paper, we propose a spatial missing data imputation method for multi-view urban statistical data. To address this problem, we exploit an improved spatial multi-kernel clustering method to guide the imputation process cooperating with an adaptive-weight non-negative matrix factorization strategy. Intensive experiments are conducted with other state-of-the-art approaches on six real-world urban statistical datasets. The results not only show the superiority of our method against other comparative methods on different datasets, but also represent a strong generalizability of our model.</p>

<p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Urban traffic light control is an important and challenging real-world problem. By regarding intersections as agents, most of the Reinforcement Learning (RL) based methods generate actions of agents independently. They can cause action conflict and result in overflow or road resource waste in adjacent intersections. Recently, some collaborative methods have alleviated the above problems by extending the observable surroundings of agents, which can be considered as inactive cross-agent communication methods. However, when agents act synchronously in these works, the perceived action value is biased and the information exchanged is insufficient. In this work, we propose a novel Multi-agent Communication and Action Rectification (MaCAR) framework. It enables active communication between agents by considering the impact of synchronous actions of agents. MaCAR consists of two parts: (1) an active Communication Agent Network (CAN) involving a Message Propagation Graph Neural Network (MPGNN); (2) a Traffic Forecasting Network (TFN) which learns to predict the traffic after agents’ synchronous actions and the corresponding action values. By using predicted information, we mitigate the action value bias during training to help rectify agents’ future actions. In experiments, we show that our proposal can outperforms state-of-the-art methods on both synthetic and real-world datasets.</p>

<p><strong>ASBTRACT</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Predicting anomalies (e.g., blocked driveway and vehicle collisions) in urban space plays an important role in assisting governments and communities for building smart city applications, ranging from intelligent transportation to public safety. However, predicting urban anomalies is not trivial due to the following two factors: i) The sequential transition regularities of anomaly occurrences is complex, which exhibit with high-order and dynamic correlations. ii) The Interactions between region, time and anomaly category is multi-dimensional in real-world urban anomaly forecasting scenario. How to fuse multiple relations from spatial, temporal and categorical dimensions in the predictive framework remains a significant challenge. To address these two challenges, we propose a Cross-Interaction Hierarchical Attention network model (CHAT) which uncovers the dynamic occurrence patterns of time-stamped urban anomaly data. Our CHAT framework could automatically capture the relevance of past anomaly occurrences across different time steps, and discriminates which types of cross-modal interactions are more important for making future predictions. Experiment results demonstrate the superiority of CHAT framework over state-of-the-art baselines.</p>

<p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The increasing amount of urban data enable us to investigate urban dynamics, assist urban planning, and eventually, make our cities more livable and sustainable. In this paper, we focus on learning an embedding space from urban data for urban regions. For the first time, we propose a multi-view joint learning model to learn comprehensive and representative urban region embeddings. We first model different types of region correlations based on both human mobility and inherent region properties. Then, we apply a graph attention mechanism in learning region representations from each view of the built correlations. Moreover, we introduce a joint learning module that boosts the region embedding learning by sharing cross-view information and fuses multi-view embeddings by learning adaptive weights. Finally, we exploit the learned embeddings in the downstream applications of land usage classification and crime prediction in urban areas with real-world data. Extensive experiment results demonstrate that by exploiting our proposed joint learning model, the performance is improved by a large margin on both tasks compared with the state-of-the-art methods.</p>

<p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Trajectory similarity computation is a core problem in the field of trajectory data queries. However, the high time complexity of calculating the trajectory similarity has always been a bottleneck in real-world applications. Learning-based methods can map trajectories into a uniform embedding space to calculate the similarity of two trajectories with embeddings in constant time. In this paper, we propose a novel trajectory representation learning framework Traj2SimVec that performs scalable and robust trajectory similarity computation. We use a simple and fast trajectory simplification and indexing approach to obtain triplet training samples efficiently. We make the framework more robust via taking full use of the sub-trajectory similarity information as auxiliary supervision. Furthermore, the framework supports the point matching query by modeling the optimal matching relationship of trajectory points under different distance metrics. The comprehensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that our model substantially outperforms all existing approaches.</p>

<p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Population flow prediction is one of the most fundamental components in many applications from urban management to transportation schedule. It is challenging due to the complicated spatial-temporal correlation.While many studies have been done in recent years, they fail to simultaneously and effectively model the spatial correlation and temporal variations among population flows. In this paper, we propose Convolution based Sequential and Cross Network (CSCNet) to solve them. On the one hand, we design a CNN based sequential structure with progressively merging the flow features from different time in different CNN layers to model the spatial-temporal information simultaneously. On the other hand, we make use of the transition flow as the proxy to efficiently and explicitly capture the dynamic correlation between different types of population flows. Extensive experiments on 4 datasets demonstrate that CSCNet outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines by reducing the prediction error around 7.7%∼10.4%.</p>

<p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Traffic prediction is a classical spatial-temporal prediction problem with many real-world applications such as intelligent route planning, dynamic traffic management, and smart location-based applications. Due to the high nonlinearity and complexity of traffic data, deep learning approaches have attracted much interest in recent years. However, few methods are satisfied with both long and short-term prediction tasks. Target at the shortcomings of existing studies, in this paper, we propose a novel deep learning framework called Long Short-term Graph Convolutional Networks (LSGCN) to tackle both traffic prediction tasks. In our framework, we propose a new graph attention network called cosAtt, and integrate both cosAtt and graph convolution networks (GCN) into a spatial gated block. By the spatial gated block and gated linear units convolution (GLU), LSGCN can efficiently capture complex spatial-temporal features and obtain stable prediction results. Experiments with three real-world traffic datasets verify the effectiveness of LSGCN.</p>

<p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Time series prediction is an important problem in machine learning. Previous methods for time series prediction did not involve additional information. With a lot of dynamic knowledge graphs available, we can use this additional information to predict the time series better. Recently, there has been a focus on the application of deep representation learning on dynamic graphs. These methods predict the structure of the graph by reasoning over the interactions in the graph at previous time steps. In this paper, we propose a new framework to incorporate the information from dynamic knowledge graphs for time series prediction. We show that if the information contained in the graph and the time series data are closely related, then this inter-dependence can be used to predict the time series with improved accuracy. Our framework, DArtNet, learns a static embedding for every node in the graph as well as a dynamic embedding which is dependent on the dynamic attribute value (time-series). Then it captures the information from the neighborhood by taking a relation specific mean and encodes the history information using RNN. We jointly train the model link prediction and attribute prediction. We evaluate our method on five specially curated datasets for this problem and show a consistent improvement in time series prediction results. We release the data and code of model DArtNet for future research.</p>

<p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>In big cities, there are plenty of parking spaces, but we often find nowhere to park. For example, New York has 1.4 million cars and 4.4 million on-street parking spaces, but it is still not easy to find a parking place near our destination, especially during peak hours. The reason is the lack of prediction of parking behavior. If we could provide parking behavior in advance, we can ease this parking problem that affects human well-being. We observe that parking lots have periodic parking patterns, which is an important factor for parking behavior prediction. Unfortunately, existing work ignores such periodic parking patterns in parking behavior prediction, and thus incurs low accuracy. To solve this problem, we propose PewLSTM, a novel periodic weather-aware LSTM model that successfully predicts the parking behavior based on historical records, weather, environments, and weekdays. PewLSTM has been successfully integrated into a real parking space reservation system, ThsParking, which is one of the top smart parking platforms in China. Based on 452,480real parking records in 683 days from 10 parking lots, PewLSTM yields 85.3% parking prediction accuracy, which is about 20% higher than the state-of-the-art parking behavior prediction method.
